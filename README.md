# cerebral

![Tests](https://github.com/Robert-Forrest/cerebral/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

Tool for creating multi-output deep ensemble neural-networks for alloy property modelling.

See our paper [Machine-learning improves understanding of glass formation in
metallic
systems](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/dd/d2dd00026a) for
discussion of the model, it's architecture, and performance.

## Installation

The cerebral package can be installed from
[pypi](https://pypi.org/project/cerebral/) using pip:

``pip install cerebral``

Cerebral makes heavy use of the
[metallurgy](https://github.com/Robert-Forrest/metallurgy) package to manipulate
and approximate properties of alloys. Cerebral can be used with the
[evomatic](https://github.com/Robert-Forrest/evomatic) package to perform alloy
searching.
